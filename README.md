Pitchers_PTRS2014
=================

This is the repository for Code and Data for Pitchers et. al. 2014 soon to be published (we think) in Philosophical Transactions of the royal society. In addition to all of the code and data being here allowing you to reproduce all of the results from the paper (up to the limits of MCMC anyways), it also contains the database we generated on genetic covariance and correlation matrices that we hope will be of broad use to the Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics community. 
Here is a short guide to navigate this folder

1. If you would like you can review or reproduce our analyses. You can also download the name.R file to rerun it on your local machine. This folder also contains the name.Rmd file in case you prefer starting with the markdown + code.

2. If you are interested just in the data, please find it in the data subfolder. Inside you will see additional sub-folders which contain small text files for each matrix as spelled out in the name.md file mentioned above.
